# NIST Risk Register – Cloud Compliance Use Case

This project presents a sample risk register and NIST CSF control mapping for a fictional health-tech startup operating in the cloud. The exercise simulates how a GRC analyst might document, assess, and mitigate common IT risks using industry-standard frameworks.

## Project Overview

- **Company Scenario:** BrightBridge Health (remote-first startup)
- **Focus:** Identifying and mitigating risks related to cloud infrastructure, user access, and third-party integrations
- **Framework Used:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## Included Deliverables

1. **Risk Register (Excel):**
   - Assets evaluated: AWS S3, employee endpoints, web applications, documentation platforms, APIs
   - Risk ratings based on likelihood and impact
   - Mapped controls to NIST CSF functions and categories
   - Control justifications for each mitigation action

2. **Control Mapping & Summary:**
   - Top risks prioritized by risk level and business impact
   - Justified mitigation strategies linked to NIST categories:
     - PR.AC – Access Control
     - PR.DS – Data Security
     - PR.IP – Information Protection
     - ID.RA – Risk Assessment

3. **Analysis Summary:**
   - Explanation of prioritization logic
   - List of top assets and controls
   - Strategic insight into risk-driven GRC thinking

## Why It Matters

GRC analysts are responsible for translating technical vulnerabilities into strategic risks that align with regulatory and organizational standards. This project demonstrates core competencies in:

- Risk assessment methodology
- Framework-based control mapping
- Documentation for audit readiness
- Strategic justification of security investments
